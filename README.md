# Runge Kutta Based IVP Problem Solver
This mini project includes three ways of solving an IVP using 4th order Runge Kutta method. First approach uses a pure python file, second uses python and cython, third includes a pure C++ approach. 

## Approach

Certain errors were raised if an unexpected situation arised. 

## Running the code

The main python file is named as main. This main file calls the rk4 function file, which in turn calls the eom files to compute the values of k1, k2, k3 and k4 used in the Runge-Kutta 4 formula. This project was developed using Python 3.7 and fix for using it with Python 2 is yet to be included. 

## Running the tests

There is only one unit test has been included. The unit test file needs to be run from the command line.
