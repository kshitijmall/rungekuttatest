Description
----------------

This mini project includes three ways of solving an IVP using 4th order Runge
Kutta method. First approach uses a pure python file, second uses python and
cython, third includes a pure C++ approach.


Approach
-------------------------------------

The main python file is named as main. This main file calls the rk4 function
file, which in turn calls the eom files to compute the values of k1, k2, k3 and
k4 used in the Runge-Kutta 4 formula. This project was developed using Python
3.7 and fix for using it with Python 2 is yet to be included. An error is
raised if an unexpected situation arises.

The C++ file consists only one main file, which includes the eom and rk4
functions as well. This file is heavily commented and the user would notice
that the approach is very similar to the python code, where the idea is to
compute the values of k1, k2, k3, and k4 to compute the new state values based
on the RK4 formula.


Usage
-----

To run the code from the terminal, the user can just clone/download the files
and then use the terminal to run the shell script named run. To run such a
shell script, the user need to just type:
sh run.sh

The run shell script would run the python code first and then the C++ code.
The energy plot would be displayed for the python code along with the
computation time. After the user closes the figure window of the energy plot,
the C++ code would then execute and display the computation time for this
hypersonics problem.
